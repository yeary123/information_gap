# information_gap
Work on some interesting projects together that can eliminate the information gap.

# Some Interesting Information Gaps
1. English foreign teachers from the Philippines can charge as low as 9 yuan for one class on Pinduoduo.
2. The psychological counseling industry is a mixed bag. There are inexpensive consultations that cost less than 100 yuan each, and I've also heard of ones that cost thousands of yuan.

# Weak Ties
Weak Ties is a concept in social network theory. It is in contrast to strong ties and refers to the relationships between people that are not close, with a low frequency of interaction and a relatively shallow emotional bond. For example, colleagues you meet at an industry conference or friends of your friends are usually regarded as weak ties.

## Functions
Weak ties are an important source of new information. Since people with weak ties are in different social circles, they can bring information that is not available in your original social circle. For instance, netizens you meet on a technology forum may share with you the latest industry trends, and such information is not so easy to obtain within your circle of family and close friends (strong ties).

## Conclusion
Therefore, expanding weak ties is a very effective way to bridge the information gap.

# How to Get Weak Ties?
## WeChat Official Account Operators
Some WeChat official account operators are very eager to connect with their readers. They come from all walks of life and usually put their contact information in prominent positions. We can try to collect their information.
